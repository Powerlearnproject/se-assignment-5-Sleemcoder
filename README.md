"version": "0.2.0",
"configurations": [
{
"name": "Python: Current File",
"type": "python",
"request": "launch",
"program": "${file}",
"console": "integratedTerminal"
}
]
}
For JavaScript (Node.js), a basic launch.json might look like this:
json
Copy code
{
"version": "0.2.0",
"configurations": [
{
"type": "node",
"request": "launch",
"name": "Launch Program",
"program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
}
]
} 5. Set Breakpoints

Launch the Debugger: In the Debug panel, select the configuration you created (e.g., Python: Current File or Launch Program) and click the green play button.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints: Allows you to pause execution at specific lines of code to inspect variables and program state.
Watch Expressions: Lets you monitor the value of variables or expressions over time.
Call Stack: Shows the call stack at any point in the execution to help trace the flow of your program.
Variable Inspection: Hover over variables in the editor to see their current value, or use the Variables pane in the Debug panel.
Step Through Code:
Step Over (F10): Executes the next line of code, but doesn't step into functions.
Step Into (F11): Steps into the function calls on the current line.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Steps out of the current function.
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when a specific condition is met.
Right-click on a breakpoint and select Edit Breakpoint to add a condition.
Debug Console: Evaluate expressions and execute commands within the context of your paused program.
Integrated Terminal: Run and debug your programs directly from the VS Code terminal.
Example Debugging Session
Set a Breakpoint: In main.py, set a breakpoint on result = add(3, 5).
Start Debugging: Click the green play button with the Python: Current File configuration selected.
Inspect Variables: When the execution pauses at the breakpoint, hover over a and b to see their values.
Step Over: Press F10 to step over to the next line (print(f"The result is {result}")).
